        <h1>Gullfoss waterfall</h1>
        <p>
          Gullfoss (Golden Waterfall) is an iconic waterfall of Iceland offering
          a spectacular view of the forces and beauty of untouched nature.
          Gullfoss is part of the Golden Circle tour, located in South Iceland
          on the Hvítá (White) river which is fed by Iceland´s second biggest
          glacier, the Langjökull. The water plummets down 32 meters in two
          stages into a rugged canyon which walls reach up to 70 meters in
          height. On a sunny day shimmering rainbow can be seen over the falls.

        <h1>Skogafoss waterfall</h1>
        <p>
          Skógafoss is one of Iceland’s biggest and most beautiful waterfalls
          with an astounding width of 25 meters (82 feet) and a drop of 60
          meters (197 feet). Due to the amount of spray the cascade produces, at
          least one rainbow is present any time the sun emerges from behind the
          clouds

        <h1>Svartifoss waterfall</h1>
        <p>
          Svartifoss (Black Falls) is a waterfall in Skaftafell in Vatnajökull
          National Park in Iceland, and is one of the most popular sights in the
          park. It is surrounded by dark lava columns, which gave rise to its
          name. Other well-known columnar jointing formations are seen at the
          Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, Devil's Tower in Wyoming, United
          States and on the island of Staffa in Scotland. There are also similar
          formations throughout Iceland, including a small cave on the beach of
          Reynisdrangar.
